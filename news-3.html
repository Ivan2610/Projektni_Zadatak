            <h2 style="color: black;">Could we see the Kings Canyon map in the Season 4 again?</h2>
            <p class="description"> Apex Legends players are calling for the return of the classic ‘Kings Canyon’ map after developers Respawn Entertainment removed it from the game for the start of Season 3: Meltdown.</p>
            <p>Many Apex Legends players have been enjoying the change to the new World’s Edge map that was released in Season 3.</p>
            <p>However, there are also many fans who would like to see the return of the arena they grew to love since the game first launched on February 4, 2019.</p>
            <p>During the early stages of Season 3, players were able to return to Kings Canyon for a limited time in the Shadowfall LTM, but now they want the iconic map to return for good.</p>
            <p>As Season 3 is starting to come to a close, one Reddit user u/jdsexy called for the return of the arena in Season 4 and received overwhelming support from others in the community. </p>
